# Testing-the-Efficient-Market-Hypothesis
  I use the Hurst Exponent to estimate the degree to which Canadian large cap stocks and Canadian small cap stocks are "efficient"--that is, if past observations can predict future observations.  I conclude that markets are mostly efficient in the long run with periods of inefficiency in the short run.
