# Testing-the-Efficient-Market-Hypothesis
I use the Hurst Exponent to estimate the degree to which Canadian large cap stocks and Canadian small cap stocks are "efficient"--that is, if past observations can predict future observations.  

I conclude that markets are mostly efficient in the long run but there are periods of inefficiency in the short run. Also, the difference in efficiency between large cap stocks and small cap stocks is immaterial. Given this, I recommend that investors invest in low-cost index funds.
